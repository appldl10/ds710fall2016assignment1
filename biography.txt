1. Dustin Applegate
2. I am interested in data science for the challenges & opportunities that it presents me in this ever evolving digital landscape. It is a direction I wish to continue to expand my career in, and an area of study that energizes me.
3. I have a strong background in SQL, a moderate level of experience with SAS, and an introduction to R from the Foundations DS course. Other than R, my knowledge has been developed through self study and (more often than not) trial & error. I utilize SQL on a weekly basis, but my time in SAS has decreased drastically over the years.
4.  I feel I have just enough statistics experience to make myself dangerous. I have some background in descriptive statistics, decision trees, and regression in a professional environment. I took some introductory courses for a previous masters program and the DS 700 course.
5.  Outside of the foundations course, I do not have any further experience with R. I am excited to begin adding to that knowledge as well as learning Python.
6.  Iâ€™m hoping to gain a better understanding and knowledge of how to utilize the two programming languages in my day to day work. Knowing when & where to apply one over the other will be valuable as well as the limitations of the two solutions. 
7.  Nothing at this time.
